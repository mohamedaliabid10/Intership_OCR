When running the "Runner.sh" in mindocr rep , you will get the ocr result here : "/home/mohamedaliabid/IOvisionOCR/mindocr-dali/mindocr/inference_results/system_results.txt"
the result need to be in json format , i changed it manually here , didnt bother to change it from the code source since the model didnt give me a good result
when running the "main.py" you will get the images with annotations
